# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/lang/en.json
    - assets/lang/ar.json
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-SemiBold.ttf

    - family: Source Sans 3
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sans/SourceSans3-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sans/SourceSans3-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sans/SourceSans3-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sans/SourceSans3-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sans/SourceSans3-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sans/SourceSans3-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: El Messiri
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/El_Messiri/ElMessiri-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/El_Messiri/ElMessiri-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/El_Messiri/ElMessiri-Regular.ttf
